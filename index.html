        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I first starting 'coding' in 1998, but I didn't consider myself a 'coder'; I was "putting tags around text".  Companies having their own websites was a new thing back then, and whilst working for a legal publications company.</p>
        <p>I didn't really understand the technical intricacies of what I was doing, but I really enjoyed it.  Especially having to look for 'broken' code when text did not display properly.</p>
        <p>I have always been drawn to projects and tasks that require problem solving as well as creativity.</p>

        <h2>Plans</h2>
        <p>I plan on mastering as many coding languages as I can, but in particular for web development: front <em>and</em> back end.</p>
        <p>The coding languages that I am currently familiar with, are:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML; and</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have had a taster of <strong>JavaScript</strong> too, and dabbled a little with <strong>SQL</strong>.</p>
        <p>Being a Web Developer means I can marry my two passions: technical flare and creativity...bliss!</p>
